In this project I created a number guessing game. The user has to guess a random number between 1 and 100. There are two difficulties. Hard difficulty gives the player 5 chances at guessing the number. Easy gives the player 10 chances. Every wrong guess results in 1 less chance. The game goes on until the user either runs out of chances or the user correctly guesses the number. If the users guess is less than the number to guess it will let them know they've guessed too low. If the users guess is higher than the number to guess it lets them know they've guessed too high. If the user runs out of attempts the number to guess will be revealed and the game will restart. Once the user correctly guesses the number it is revealed and they are asked if they want to play again.
