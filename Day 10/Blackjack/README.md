In this project I built a text based blackjack game before I start writing code I had to first figure out how blackjack works.

How does blackjack work? Before the deal, players place bets in designated betting areas. The dealer gives two cards to each player and two to themselves (one face up, one face down). Cards are valued like this, number cards between 2 and 10 are worth their face value, face cards Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10, and Aces can either be 1 or 11. A blackjack is a hand with an initial two cards totaling 21 (an ace and a 10 value card). The player decides whether to hit which means they take another card or stand when they want to end their turn. Once all players have finished, the dealer reveals their hidden card and must hit until their hand reaches a total of 17 or higher. The player with a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it wins. If the player's hand exceeds 21 it's a "bust" and they lose. If both player and dealer have the same hand value (including blackjack), it's a "push" (tie), and the bet is returned.
