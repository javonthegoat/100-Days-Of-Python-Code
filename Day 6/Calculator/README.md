This project is a text based calculator program. I will create functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Each function will take two arguments. I will then create a dictionary where the keys are the math operators. The values in the dictionary will hold the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions. The program will start off by telling the user to enter a number. I will then convert the input into a float. Once the user enters a number I will ask them to choose between one of the operators (+, -, *, /). After the user choose an operator I will ask them to enter a second number. Now I will create a new variable that stores the result of the operation. The result of the operation can be created by passing the operator from the users input as a key to the operations dictionary, this will get the function that we are performing for the operation (add, subtract, multiply, division). Then we pass the the first operand and the second operand to the function. Lastly we print to the console using an f string the result of the operation.
